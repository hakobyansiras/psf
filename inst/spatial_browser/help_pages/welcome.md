## Welcome to the PSF Spatial Browser App

Welcome to the PSF Spatial Browser app! This application is designed for interactive exploration of pathway activity analysis results from spatial transcriptomic datasets. Pathway activity analysis is conducted using the Pathway Signal Flow (PSF) algorithm, which is implemented in the PSF toolkit R package [1]. PSF utilizes gene expression data in combination with pathway topology and interaction information to calculate branch-level activity within pathways [2].

With this app, you can visualize gene expression and pathway activity values on spatial tissue slices and rendered pathway networks. Both visualization sections are interactive, allowing for detailed exploration of the spatial transcriptomics data. The PSF Spatial Browser aims to provide a tool for users interested in a functional analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets with focus on topology rich pathway networks.
